# Introduction
msie2vbox creates VirtualBox machines from the Microsoft Application Compatibility VPC images that Microsoft provide for testing websites in Internet Explorer versions 6, 7 or 8.  This application only supports downloading and installing the Windows XP VPC image.  This image defaults to IE6 but contains shortcuts to update to IE7 or IE8.  It is recommended that a local copy of the downloaded VPC image be kept to make creating subsequent VirtualBox VMs quicker.

To run msie2vbox, just execute in a shell.

>`./msie2vbox.sh`

## Dependencies
* [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) (Available in most package managers as "p7zip")
* [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
* [mkisofs](http://freshmeat.net/projects/mkisofs/) (Included in package "cdrtools")

## Options
This program can be used to create a new VirtualBox machine from a Microsoft
Application Compatibility VPC image.  Since the original Microsoft images
are built for Microsoft Virtual PC, there are a few 'inconsistencies'*. At present,
this script only supports IE 6,7,8 under Windows XP.

The VMs can be installed to a specific location supplied by the '-l <path>' argument
or by default to ~/vbox/.  The VM will be named based on the current timestamp,
e.g. 'Windows_XP_IE_$(date +%s)', or by the name supplied by the '-n <name>' argument.

Each VM will default to 192M RAM; this can be overridden with the '-mN' argument where
'N' is the desired amount of RAM to allocate, in megabytes.  This program will
download the appropriate VPC image, but you can specify the path to a local VPC image
using the '-f <path>' argument.

The VMs require the Intel 82540EM network adapter.  Drivers for this are downloaded and
built into a ready-mounted ISO when the VM is booted.  You will need to manually
update the network adapter drivers before verifying your VM with Microsoft. 

By default, the VM will not boot when this script is complete.  Use the '-b' argument
to boot the VM.

>  -h            Show this message  
>  -m            RAM to allocate (in MB)  
>  -n            Name of the Virtual Machine  
>  -f            Path to existing VPC image  
>  -d            Path to Intel Drivers EXE  
>  -l            Path to store VHD files  
>  -b            Boot VM on completion.  
  

## Examples
### IE 7
* IE 7
* Existing local copy of Intel drivers in /home/max/Desktop/PROWin32.exe
* Default 192Mb RAM
* Default name of Windows_XP_IE_$(date +%s)
* Download the VPC image
  
>`./msie2vbox.sh -d /home/max/Desktop/PROWin32.exe`

After installation, you will need to use the desktop shortcut to update the machine to IE7.

### IE8
* IE8
* Use 265Mb RAM
* Name of 'WinXPIE8'
* Boot on completion
* Specify path to existing VPC executable
* Download Intel Drivers

>`./msie2vbox -m 256 -f /path/to/Windows_XP_IE6.exe -n WinXPIE8 -b`

After installation, you will need to use the desktop shortcut to update the machine to IE8.

After booting the VM for the first time, you will be prompted to activate Windows XP.  Cancel the activation
for now, and log in using the password 'Password1'.  Open Device Manager, right-click on the ethernet adapter and
  selected 'Reinstall Driver'.  Search for the driver automatically, and it should install the drivers from the
  attached CD image.

You should next install the VirtualBox Guest Additions.  Once the installation is complete, you can reboot the VM
and complete the activiation process; this should work okay.  I've noticed that occasionally installation of the Guest
Additions causes the machine to appear to crash.  You can powercycle the VM, activate Windows XP, and generally
the second attempt at installing the Guest Additions works fine.

## *Inconsistencies / Manual Steps
* The VM is configured without USB support
* The VM is configured without audio
* Update the drivers for the ethernet device with those provided on the pre-mounted D:\ drive
* Validate the VM with Microsoft
* Install the Virtual Box Guest Additions
* Disable 'battery' devices

## To Do
* Investigate use of registry files or other some alternative method to automate driver installation
* Automated installation of Vbox Guest Additions
